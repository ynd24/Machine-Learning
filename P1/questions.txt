The time complexity of the predict function can be analyzed as follows:

Initializing an empty list yHat takes O(1) time.

The for loop that iterates over xFeat has a time complexity of O(m), where m is the number of samples in xFeat.

Inside the for loop, the euclidean_distance function is called, which computes the Euclidean distance between two arrays. The time complexity of this function is O(d * m), where d is the number of features in each sample.

The np.argsort function is called to sort the distances, which has a time complexity of O(m * log(m)).

The ind array is sliced to get the k nearest neighbors, which takes O(k).

The for loop that iterates over self.y_train[df[0]] has a time complexity of O(k).

In the worst case, the if statement will be executed once for each sample in xFeat, which takes O(m) time.

Appending a value to yHat takes O(1) time.

Putting it all together, the overall time complexity of the predict function is O(m * (d + log(m) + k + 1)). 

The overall time complexity will be O(m*(d+log(m)))
